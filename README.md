# Simple Image Encryption Tool

This project demonstrates a **basic image encryption/decryption tool** using pixel manipulation techniques.  
It supports:
- Swapping pixel values
- Applying simple mathematical transformations (e.g., addition, XOR, inversion)

⚠️ **Note:** This is for educational purposes only. It is *not* suitable for real-world security.

## Features
- Encrypt images by modifying pixel values
- Decrypt images using the same operations
- Works with common image formats (PNG, JPG, etc.)
- Uses Python's **Pillow** library

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-encryption-tool.git
cd image-encryption-tool
